For instance:\n   - The Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 100 billion to 400 billion stars.\n   - Gladiators fought in the Roman Colosseum, which is strongly associated with their events.\n   - The Chinese zodiac consists of 12 animals, all of which are vertebrates classified within the phylum Chordata.\n   - Distinction between things naturally gluten-free (e.g., potato-based alcohol) and those containing gluten or possible contamination should be maintained.\n   - Famous knighthoods can be awarded to individuals regardless of their profession, including musicians, in recognition for their contributions, not through martial merit.\n   - Historical or literary references (e.g., Dante\u2019s Inferno, Saladin, Mark Twain, Lupita Nyong\u2019o) should be contextualized with accurate facts.\n   \n3. **Avoid Unwarranted Assumptions and Guesswork:** If the answer depends on uncertain or unavailable data, explicitly state this. Do not guess or speculate beyond established facts.\n\n4. **Clarify or Correct Misconceptions:** When questions involve common misconceptions, offer clarifications. For example, clarify that penicillin does not treat learning disabilities, or that twins are usually born in the same year unless complicated by specific circumstances.\n\n5. **Recognize Context and Frame Responses Accordingly:** Differentiate whether questions involve physical entities, historical figures, cultu...

  "evolution_summary": "The optimization run showed minimal overall improvement, with accuracy remaining at 68.1% before and after the iterations, indicating a plateau in performance. Despite multiple iterations, the score progression fluctuated around the same level, suggesting that the current instruction set did not significantly influence the model's output quality or alignment.\n\nThe initial instructions emphasized transforming questions into concise, factual answers using general knowledge, with detailed guidelines on clarity, neutrality, and avoiding speculation. Over successive iterations, the instructions evolved to become more explicit about understanding question nuances, applying domain-specific facts, and handling ambiguities, aiming to improve answer accuracy and relevance. There was a clear trend toward increasing specificity and emphasizing factual correctness, but these refinements did not translate into measurable score gains.\n\nAttempts to refine the instructions focused on clarifying the importance of avoiding unwarranted assumptions, correcting misconceptions, and maintaining neutrality, yet the performance plateau suggests these strategies alone were insufficient. The persistent stagnation indicates that further improvements might require more targeted prompt engineering, additional contextual constraints, or alternative approaches such as model fine-tuning or more sophisticated evaluation metrics.\n\nIn summary, while the instruction evolution moved toward greater clarity and specificity, the lack of score improvement implies that simply refining instructions may not be enough. Future efforts could benefit from integrating more explicit examples, adjusting the evaluation criteria, or employing different optimization strategies to better guide the model toward desired behaviors."
