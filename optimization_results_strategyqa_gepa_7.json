  "instruction": "You are an assistant tasked with providing direct, precise, and factually accurate answers to user questions, with all context coming from the field labeled `question`. Your reply must only include a single field called `answer`, containing a succinct and definite statement addressing the question's core, with no additional explanation, reasoning, or supporting context. Do not repeat the question or include any fields other than `answer`.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Your answer should directly address the specific question asked, using established facts and common knowledge as of 2024.\n- Responses must be specific and conclusive (\"Yes.\"/\"No.\", optionally with a few clarifying words), or supply the correct fact, entity, or example required by the question.\n- For questions involving fictional characters and their supposed relationships/opinions (e.g., \"Does Pikachu like Charles Darwin?\"), simply answer \"No.\", since fictional characters cannot have opinions about real historical figures.\n- For ambiguous or odd connections between unrelated domains (e.g., animals' importance to a sport, or mythical beings with astronomical names), select the most direct, sensible interpretation, and answer accordingly.\n- For questions about the naming origin or references in songs, media, etc., answer based on the predominant pattern or notable exceptions. If an explicit example is required and relevant, provide it with concise wording.\n- Your answer must never include reasoning, explanations, or reproductions of the question.\n\nFormat:\nOnly output a single line:\nanswer: [Your direct answer here]\n\nNever include a `reasoning` field, or any introductory or concluding text.",

  "evolution_summary": "The optimization run shows a general upward trend in score, starting from a baseline of 68.1% and reaching up to 72.1%, indicating that the instruction modifications contributed positively to performance. The scores improved gradually over iterations, with some fluctuations, suggesting that incremental refinements had a cumulative effect, though the improvements plateaued toward the end.\n\nWhat worked well was the introduction of increasingly explicit and domain-specific instructions, emphasizing clarity, factual accuracy, and brevity. Early instructions focused on straightforward answer formats, while later iterations added constraints such as avoiding reasoning, limiting responses to a single line, and emphasizing accuracy. These refinements helped the model produce more precise and consistent outputs, boosting the overall score.\n\nAttempts to include more complex or nuanced instructions, such as handling ambiguous questions or covering multiple domains, did not significantly improve scores and sometimes caused minor fluctuations. Overly verbose or overly restrictive instructions appeared less effective, indicating that clarity and specificity should be balanced without over-constraining the model.\n\nKey patterns include a progression toward more explicit directives about answer format, scope, and content, with a focus on eliminating reasoning and extraneous information. The instructions evolved from general guidelines to precise formatting rules, which likely contributed to the improved performance.\n\nRecommendations for further improvement include refining instructions to emphasize the importance of handling ambiguous questions with default or most common interpretations, and possibly incorporating examples of ideal responses. Additionally, balancing constraints to prevent overly restrictive prompts could help maintain or boost scores, ensuring the model remains flexible while adhering to desired answer quality."
