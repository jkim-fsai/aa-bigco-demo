  "evolution_summary": "The optimization trajectory exhibited significant fluctuations with multiple score peaks and valleys, ultimately resulting in a slight decline of 0.6% from the baseline accuracy. Initial iterations maintained high scores around 76-77%, but subsequent runs showed instability, with scores dropping as low as 65.7% before recovering to higher values like 91.4%. This pattern suggests that the optimization process struggled to consistently improve or stabilize performance, indicating potential overfitting or sensitivity to instruction variations.\n\nThe instruction evolution reveals a progression toward more detailed and structured prompts. Early iterations emphasized clear reasoning and factual extraction, gradually incorporating explicit step-by-step analysis, detailed reasoning, and high-stakes precision. This shift toward more comprehensive instructions aimed to guide the model toward more careful and accurate responses. However, despite these efforts, the overall performance did not improve, implying that increased complexity or specificity in instructions alone did not translate into better outcomes.\n\nNotably, the instructions became increasingly verbose and focused on accuracy, transparency, and justification, reflecting an attempt to enforce careful reasoning. Yet, the persistent score volatility suggests that overly complex or rigid instructions may have introduced noise or confusion, hindering consistent improvements. The evolution indicates an exploration of balancing detailed guidance with simplicity to optimize model responses.\n\nTo enhance results further, it is advisable to refine instruction clarity without excessive complexity, possibly incorporating iterative feedback mechanisms or adaptive prompts. Simplifying instructions while maintaining emphasis on accuracy and reasoning could reduce variability and promote more stable performance gains. Additionally, integrating targeted fine-tuning based on observed weaknesses may help translate instruction improvements into measurable accuracy enhancements."
