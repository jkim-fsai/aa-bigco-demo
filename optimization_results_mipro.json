  "evolution_summary": "The optimization trajectory shows fluctuating performance with notable peaks around iterations 7, 8, 13, 14, 19, and 20, indicating that the model's scores varied significantly across instruction changes. Overall, there was a slight net improvement (+0.5%) from the baseline, but the scores did not improve monotonically, suggesting some iterations may have introduced noise or conflicting guidance.\n\nInitially, the instructions evolved from a simple directive (\"produce answer\") to more detailed, step-by-step reasoning prompts. Early iterations emphasized clarity and precision, with a focus on accuracy and directness. Later iterations maintained this emphasis but increasingly incorporated explicit reasoning instructions, such as \"reason step-by-step,\" aiming to enhance correctness. The final instruction consolidates these strategies into a balanced, clear directive emphasizing careful analysis and accuracy.\n\nWhat didn't seem to help were instructions that added complexity or multiple constraints without clear benefit, as seen in the fluctuating scores. The evolution shows a trend toward increasing specificity and emphasis on reasoning, which correlates with score peaks, indicating that guiding the model to think carefully may improve performance.\n\nKey patterns include a progression from generic to more detailed, reasoning-focused instructions, suggesting that explicit reasoning prompts can positively influence accuracy. To further improve results, experimenting with more structured reasoning frameworks or combining reasoning prompts with examples could stabilize gains. Additionally, refining the instructions to reduce ambiguity and avoid conflicting directives may help achieve more consistent improvements."
