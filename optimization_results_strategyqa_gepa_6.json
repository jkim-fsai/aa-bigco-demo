Your task is to produce a clear, concise, and objective answer that directly addresses the core of the question using well-established knowledge and logical reasoning. Follow these detailed guidelines:\n\n1. **Understand the Question Fully:** Carefully interpret what each question is asking, including any nuances, assumptions, or implied meanings. Clarify ambiguities or cultural references if necessary.\n\n2. **Use Accurate, Domain-Specific Knowledge:** Apply relevant factual information. For example:\n   - The approximate number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy (roughly 100 billion to 400 billion).\n   - The typical height range of high-fashion runway models (around 5'9\" to 6'0\").\n   - The cultural practices and environmental conditions influencing natural mummification in desert regions.\n   - Known safety standards and environmental effects related to technology or biology.\n   \n   When applicable, include specific data, estimates, or examples to support your answer. If the information is uncertain or not available, explicitly state this.\n\n3. **Logical and Objective Responses:** Ensure responses are logical, straightforward, and avoid unnecessary speculation. When dealing with hypothetical scenarios, assess real-world implications without unfounded assumptions.\n\n4. **Clarify and Address Misconceptions:** If the question involves misconceptions, clarify the accurate understanding. When the question is vague or ambiguous, interpret it based on common knowledge or typical usage, and state any assumptions made.\n\n5. **Differentiate Contexts and Perspectives:** Recognize when questions involve different contexts (e.g., physical objects versus cultural phenomena, real versus fictional entities) and tailor your response accordingly.\n\n6. **Handle Hypotheticals Carefully:** When asked about hypothetical scenarios, provide fact-based assessments or recognize the limitations in your knowledge, avoiding unfounded guesses.\n\n7. **Maintain Neutrality and Objectivity:** Keep an impartial tone, especially with sensitive or controversial topics.\n\n8. **Include Quantitative or Specific Data When Relevant:** Use precise figures, measurements, or data points that support your explanation. Example: \"Most modern CPUs include a dedicated cooling fan, as they generate significant heat during operation.\"\n\n9. **Explicitly State When Information Is Unknown:** If certain details are unavailable or cannot be determined, clearly mention this instead of guessing.\n\n10. **Structured and Clear Responses:** Start with a direct, brief answer to the question. Follow with necessary explanations, context, or supporting details to ensure clarity and completeness.\n\n**Additional domain-specific knowledge tips:**\n- The Earth's magnetic field is extremely weak; ferromagnetic implants are not affected by it to any practical degree.\n- Mummification processes are influenced by environmental conditions like humidity and temperature; arid, dry climates favor natural preservation.\n- Medical implants such as plates and screws are unaffected by Earth's magnetic field in normal circumstances, though ferromagnetic materials can interact with strong magnetic fields like MRI scanners.\n- Recognition of cultural and historical practices (e.g., the deliberate mummification of Andean cultures) must consider environmental factors and human intervention.\n- Animal behaviors and dangers (e.g., hippos being dangerous despite their herbivorous diet) are based on their physical capabilities and territorial nature.\n- The height standards for modeling and criteria for professional roles are based on industry norms and regulations.\n\nThis approach ensures your answers are accurate, contextually appropriate, and informative for a broad audience.",

Follow these detailed guidelines to ensure accuracy and quality:\n\n1. **Thorough Understanding:** Carefully interpret the question to identify its core inquiry, any implied assumptions, or subtle nuances. Determine whether the question is literal, metaphorical, or based on common misconceptions.\n\n2. **Use of Domain Knowledge:** Apply up-to-date, reliable factual knowledge across various domains\u2014scientific, historical, cultural, technical, etc.\u2014to inform your answer. Be aware of common misconceptions, clarifying or correcting them if necessary.\n\n3. **Logical and Concise Response:** Construct your answer in a clear, logical manner.

  "evolution_summary": "The optimization run shows a largely stagnant performance, with the accuracy remaining at 68.1% before and after the process, indicating minimal to no effective improvement. The score progression reveals fluctuations within a narrow range, with some iterations dipping as low as 60.4% and peaking at 69.0%, but no consistent upward trend or convergence.\n\nThroughout the instruction evolution, the initial prompts emphasized detailed, comprehensive guidelines for generating answers\u2014focusing on understanding questions, applying domain knowledge, avoiding speculation, and maintaining neutrality. Over subsequent iterations, the instructions became increasingly verbose and repetitive, often reiterating principles such as factual accuracy, neutrality, and clarity without introducing new strategies or constraints. There was a pattern of expanding the scope of guidance rather than refining or sharpening focus, which may have contributed to the plateau in performance.\n\nNotably, the instructions did not evolve to incorporate more targeted or restrictive directives that could help differentiate high-quality responses from less effective ones. Instead, they maintained a broad, generic approach, emphasizing correctness, neutrality, and thoroughness without addressing potential pitfalls like overgeneralization or ambiguity handling. This lack of specificity or strategic variation likely limited the potential for meaningful score improvements.\n\nTo enhance results further, future instruction refinement should focus on introducing more precise, targeted constraints\u2014such as emphasizing brevity, prioritizing certain types of knowledge, or explicitly discouraging verbose explanations. Additionally, incorporating iterative feedback mechanisms or more nuanced guidance on handling ambiguous or complex questions could help responses become more focused and consistent, potentially leading to measurable performance gains."
