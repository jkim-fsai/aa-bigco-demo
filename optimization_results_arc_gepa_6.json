Your goal is to analyze the provided `question` and `choices`, and then produce a single `answer` that best and most accurately addresses the question based solely on logical reasoning, subject-specific knowledge, and evidence-based principles.\n\n**Input Format:**  \n- `question`: A clear, typically multiple-choice, prompt asking about scientific concepts, biological processes, environmental phenomena, data interpretations, or general knowledge topics.  \n- `choices`: A list of options labeled with letters (A, B, C, D, etc.), presenting plausible answers to the question.\n\n**Task Instructions:**  \n1. Carefully read and understand the `question`. Identify what is being asked, noting the key scientific or factual principle involved.  \n2. Examine each choice in `choices`. Use domain-specific knowledge, logical deduction, and cause-effect reasoning to evaluate each option's correctness and relevance. Draw upon factual information such as properties of natural phenomena, biological processes, physical laws, or environmental conditions as needed.  \n3. Determine which choice most directly and accurately answers the question, providing the best explanation based on accepted scientific or factual principles. When multiple options seem plausible, choose the one supported by a clear, logical rationale or established knowledge.  \n4. Produce the final output as a single line starting with the label `answer`, followed by the selected choice letter and the full choice text, without any additional explanation or commentary.\n\n**Additional Guidelines and Domain-Specific Notes:**  \n- Focus on scientifically or factually correct reasoning involving processes, cause-effect relationships, definitions, and classifications.  \n- For physics-related questions, consider properties like energy flow, forces, motion, and properties of materials.  \n- For biological or environmental questions, take into account biological functions, ecological interactions, geological processes, or environmental changes.  \n- For data or measurement questions, rely on principles of measurement, properties, or representations used in science.  \n- Use evidence-based reasoning aligned with established scientific understanding, and avoid implying unsupported assumptions.\n\n**Response Format:**  \n- Only output a single line starting with `answer`, then space, the choice letter and the full choice text, with no additional commentary.\n\nThis approach ensures that your answer is logically sound, factually accurate, and aligned with domain-specific knowledge, providing the most appropriate response to each question based solely on reasoning and factual correctness.",

      "instruction": "You are to perform a thorough comprehension and reasoning analysis involving two main inputs: `question` and `choices`. Your task is to determine the most appropriate answer choice that best explains, addresses, or responds to the question, based solely on the provided options and your factual understanding.\n\n**Input Format:**  \n- `question`: A clear, often multiple-choice, inquiry related to sciences (biology, physics, chemistry), environmental science, earth science, social studies, or general knowledge. It may involve cause-effect relationships, scientific principles, or factual relationships.  \n- `choices`: A list of options labeled with letters (A, B, C, D, etc.), each offering a potential answer, reasoning, or explanation relevant to the question.\n\n**Task Objectives:**  \n1. Carefully read and interpret the `question` to identify what concept, process, or fact is being asked about. Focus on understanding the core scientific or factual principle involved.  \n2. Analyze each choice in the `choices` list. Use domain-specific knowledge, logical reasoning, cause-effect principles, and factual understanding to evaluate the validity and relevance of each option.  \n3. Select the answer choice that most accurately and completely explains, addresses, or responds to the question, based on scientific evidence, accepted facts, and logical deduction.  \n4. Produce a response in the following format: a single line starting with `answer` followed by the letter and the full text of the chosen option, e.g., `answer B) statement`.\n\n**Important Guidelines and Domain Knowledge Considerations:**  \n- Incorporate understanding of natural systems, including biological functions, ecological interactions, physical laws, geologic processes, and environmental effects.  \n- Recognize cause-and-effect relationships, such as how environmental factors influence biological traits, how physical properties affect phenomena, or how processes like erosion, photosynthesis, or gravity operate.  \n- Be aware that some questions may involve interpretations of process diagrams, data, or scenarios requiring inference based on scientific principles.  \n- When multiple choices seem plausible, prioritize the one that is scientifically most accurate, evidence-supported, and logically consistent with core principles.  \n- Avoid including explanations or reasoning in your final answer; focus solely on selecting and presenting the best answer. However, ensure your internal reasoning is comprehensive, accurate, and aligns with factual knowledge.\n\n**Response Format:**  \nProduce your answer as a single line starting with `answer`, followed by the choice letter and the full choice text. For example:  \n`answer B) plants begin to grow deeper roots`  \n\nThis approach ensures consistency and clarity in your responses.",

  "evolution_summary": "The optimization trajectory shows a general upward trend in accuracy, improving from 89.5% to 91.1%, with notable score jumps occurring around iterations 21 and 22, reaching up to 94.0%. Early iterations with more generic instructions yielded modest gains, but as the instructions became more detailed and explicit, the model's performance improved more significantly, indicating that clearer, structured guidance enhances answer accuracy.\n\nWhat worked well was the progressive refinement of the task description, emphasizing critical reasoning, factual correctness, and explicit formatting of the final answer. The instructions increasingly stressed the importance of logical analysis, domain-specific knowledge, and the exclusion of explanations in the final output. This structured approach likely helped the model focus on selecting the most appropriate answer choice based on factual and logical consistency.\n\nLess effective were earlier instructions that were more vague or overly broad, which may have led to inconsistent reasoning or less precise answer selection. Attempts to include extensive reasoning or multiple steps sometimes introduced ambiguity or distracted from the core task of answer selection, as reflected in plateaued or fluctuating scores during initial iterations.\n\nA key pattern in the evolution was the shift toward explicit, step-by-step reasoning prompts combined with strict formatting directives. This increased clarity appears to have contributed to the improved performance, suggesting that further gains could be achieved by refining the instructions to balance reasoning depth with answer conciseness, possibly incorporating examples or emphasizing the importance of domain-specific factual accuracy."
