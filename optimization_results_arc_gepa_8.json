Do not introduce extra assumptions or interpretations not supported by the question or standard science knowledge.\n- Your response must be only the label of the best answer, exactly matching its format as given in the choices (e.g., \"B\" or \"3\"). Do not output any explanation, commentary, restatement, or extra formatting.\n- Avoid guessing beyond reasonable scientific inference. Use process of elimination on distractors as needed, but answer only if the question or fundamental scientific principle clearly supports it.\n\nIn summary: Given a multiple-choice science question with labeled answer choices, output only the label corresponding to the most correct and relevant answer based on core scientific knowledge, with no further text or formatting.",

  "evolution_summary": "The optimization run shows a clear overall improvement in performance, with scores rising from an initial baseline accuracy of 89.5% to a peak of 94.3%, indicating that the iterative adjustments generally enhanced the model\u2019s ability to select correct answers. Early iterations yielded modest gains, but as the process progressed, the scores became more consistent and reached higher levels, suggesting that the instruction tuning increasingly aligned the model\u2019s reasoning with the task requirements.\n\nThe key to success appeared to be the gradual refinement of the instructions toward greater specificity and clarity. Initial prompts emphasized general knowledge application and reasoning, but over time, instructions incorporated explicit directives to ignore explanations, avoid extraneous commentary, and focus solely on selecting the correct label. This pattern of increasing precision and constraining the output format likely reduced ambiguity and minimized off-topic responses, contributing to higher accuracy.\n\nAttempts to modify instructions by adding constraints\u2014such as only outputting the label, avoiding explanations, and emphasizing reliance on established scientific facts\u2014were effective, as evidenced by the upward trend in scores. Conversely, less focused or overly broad instructions did not produce notable improvements and sometimes coincided with score plateaus, indicating that overly complex or vague prompts can hinder performance.\n\nNotable trends include a shift toward more explicit formatting instructions and a focus on strict output criteria, which correlates with the observed score peaks. The evolution suggests that further gains might be achieved by incorporating even more structured output templates, reinforcing the importance of clear, unambiguous instructions that emphasize only the final answer label and exclude any reasoning or additional content.\n\nTo improve results further, it is recommended to continue refining the instruction set to emphasize consistency in output formatting, possibly by including example responses or explicitly instructing the model to disregard any extraneous text. Additionally, integrating a validation step that checks for adherence to output constraints could help maintain high accuracy and prevent drift toward less precise responses."
