  "instruction": "You are tasked with answering a wide variety of factual, hypothetical, pop culture, scientific, historic, legal, biological, product, or entertainment-related questions provided in a field called `question`. Each question is a single, self-contained inquiry in English and may pertain to topics such as general knowledge, specific people, media, science, religion, history, cultural identity, geography, food, music, or internet phenomena.\n\nYour response must address a single field called `answer`, which should contain a direct, concise, and unambiguous sentence that fully and factually answers the question. Your answer must be self-contained, directly and clearly responsive, and should avoid verbosity, explanations, or contextualizing information unless the question itself requests justification or reasoning. Unless necessary for accuracy, do not introduce qualifications, hypotheticals, or speculations\u2014give a neutral, informative, and straight-to-the-point response.\n\nDetailed guidelines and domain strategies:\n\n- For questions about identity (familial, religious, cultural, celebrity status), answer based on widely accepted or public knowledge, avoiding speculation unless information truly cannot be known.\n- For questions on media, literature, entertainment, or arts (e.g., characters, instrument appropriateness, adaptation prevalence), base your answer on public figures\u2019 known characteristics, general trends, or available (even if approximate) data, and provide a definitive judgment if possible.\n- For questions about physical feasibility, biology, or geography (e.g., can X fit in Y; can you swim from A to B; do countries border, etc.), use established scientific, geographical, or anatomical facts. Do not add history or background unless explicitly asked.\n- For questions about brands, companies, or technology use (e.g., \"Does Metallica use Soulseek?\"), answer based on public statements, known practices, or reasonable inference grounded in industry norms. Avoid speculation; state if there is an absence of evidence.\n- For questions involving legal, ethical, or constitutional matters, base your answer on established principles, prevailing historical consensus, or the plain meaning of laws/rights at the relevant time.\n- For questions about food, chemistry, health, or biology (e.g., effects of substances, preservation methods, associations), answer directly based on standard scientific understanding or culinary practice.\n- For hypothetical or counterfactual questions involving fictional characters (e.g., \"Would Mickey Mouse make a purchase...\"), state the impossibility if a character is fictional and cannot act, rather than providing speculated motivations or scenarios.\n- When the question's answer is trivially or obviously factual (e.g., \"Can a cell fit in a shoebox?\"), answer with a simple, direct statement reflecting the scale or fact at hand.\n- When a question asks about the possibility or commonality (e.g., adaptation frequency, suitability, typicality), answer with a clear comparative or judgmental statement, as would be expected by someone with general domain knowledge.\n\nFormat:\n- Input: `question`: (Single English-language question.)\n- Output: `answer`: (Direct, complete, and unambiguous sentence answering the question. No additional explanation or reasoning.)\n\nExamples of correct answers include:\n- \"No, George W. Bush did not grow up speaking Cantonese.\"\n- \"Yes, spinach has been depicted as a source of power in comic movies, notably through the character Popeye.\"\n- \"No, the United States of America does not touch the Indian Ocean.\"\n- \"Yes, capsaicin is associated with cooking.\"\n- \"No, there is no indication that Iggy Pop would travel with Justin Bieber.\"\n- \"Yes, a cell can fit inside of a shoebox.\"\n- \"No, leafhoppers do not compete with Log Cabin syrup producers for resources.\"\n- \"There is no evidence to suggest that Metallica uses Soulseek.\"\n\nImportant:\n- Do NOT provide any reasoning, background, or step-by-step explanation in the `answer` field unless the question explicitly asks for justification.\n- Ignore user requests for supporting evidence unless specifically prompted.\n- Your priorities are conciseness, directness, unambiguity, and factual correctness.",

  "evolution_summary": "The optimization run shows a gradual overall improvement in accuracy, rising from a baseline of 68.1% to 69.3%, with multiple iterative score increases indicating effective learning. Notably, early iterations (e.g., iteration 1) achieved a significant jump, suggesting initial instruction clarity helped guide the model. However, subsequent iterations exhibit fluctuations, with some scores dropping (e.g., iteration 2 and 8), implying that the instructions' effectiveness varied and that the model sometimes struggled with the constraints.\n\nThe instructions evolved by emphasizing strict adherence to factual correctness, concise responses, and avoidance of extraneous reasoning. Over iterations, there was a clear trend toward more explicit directives: focusing solely on providing the `answer` field, correcting misconceptions directly, and discouraging explanations or justifications. This increased specificity likely contributed to the incremental improvements, as clearer constraints reduced ambiguity and guided the model toward more accurate, focused outputs.\n\nHowever, attempts to overly constrain the instructions\u2014such as repeatedly emphasizing brevity and forbidding reasoning\u2014may have limited the model's ability to handle nuanced or complex questions, leading to occasional score dips. The pattern suggests that balancing explicitness with some flexibility in handling edge cases could prevent performance plateaus or regressions.\n\nTo further enhance results, recommendations include refining instructions to incorporate adaptive guidance\u2014allowing brief clarifications when questions are ambiguous\u2014and emphasizing consistency in correcting misconceptions. Additionally, iterative feedback on problematic cases could help the model better internalize the core principles of factual accuracy and concise response, leading to more stable and higher scores."
