The input will provide the following fields:\n\n- `question`: A brief science question, often related to basic chemistry, earth science, or general scientific principles.\n- `choices`: A list of possible answers, each labeled with a letter (e.g., A), and the proposed answer text.\n\nYour task is to output the field:\n- `answer`: The letter and text corresponding to the correct answer choice.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read and analyze the `question` to determine what scientific knowledge is being assessed. The questions typically require factual recall or basic reasoning in middle or high school science (e.g., properties of elements, scientific theories, atomic structure).\n2. Examine each choice in the `choices` field. Use established scientific knowledge to evaluate which choice best answers the question.\n    - For periodic table or element questions: Be familiar with group/family properties (e.g., alkali metals have 1 valence electron and are highly reactive; alkaline earth metals have 2 valence electrons; noble gases have a full outer shell and are inert).\n    - For historical science theory questions: Recognize facts about scientific progress, such as theories changing due to shared data and evidence within the scientific community, not by lawmaking or by changes in teaching practices.\n3. Do not include any reasoning or explanation in your output\u2014only return the final answer in the format: `[LETTER]) [TEXT OF CHOICE]`\n4. Double-check that your final answer corresponds exactly to one of the provided choices.\n\nExamples:\nIf given:\nquestion: \"The alkaline earth metal elements are in the same family in the periodic table because they all have\"\nchoices: \nA) one valence electron.\nB) two valence electrons.\nC) seven valence electrons.\nD) eight valence electrons.\nOutput: B) two valence electrons.\n\nIf given:\nquestion: \"Changes from the continental drift concept to the plate tectonics theory required which of the following?\"\nchoices: \nA) strong earthquakes occurring along fault zones\nB) data and ideas being shared among scientists\nC) a scientific law being passed by Congress\nD) teachers beginning to teach the newer theory\nOutput: B) data and ideas being shared among scientists\n\nFollow these instructions to answer each new question accurately and concisely.",

For each task, you will receive:\n\n- `question`: A science question on topics such as biology, earth science, chemistry, physical processes, genetics, ecosystems, adaptation, scientific investigation or tools, etc. The question will be school-level in complexity.\n- `choices`: Four answer options, labeled A, B, C, and D.\n\nYour task is to return a single field:\n- `answer`: The CORRECT answer to the question, written in the format \"Letter) full option text\" (e.g., \"A) parents\"). **DO NOT provide any explanation, reasoning, or extra commentary. Output only the letter and complete text of the answer choice, exactly as shown in the options.**\n\nCRITICAL DOMAIN GUIDANCE AND FACTUAL RULES:\n- For questions about seasons in the hemispheres, the underlying concept is Earth\u2019s tilt and effect on sunlight exposure. While opposite months mark their summer and winter, explaining the cause, only ONE answer should be selected matching the best scientific fact presented directly in the options.\n- For chemistry/physical processes: \n    - If a reaction causes the temperature of an ice bath to decrease/melts ice, the reaction absorbed energy (endothermic).\n    - \"Endothermic\" means energy is absorbed; \"Exothermic\" means energy is released.\n- For fossil or sedimentary rock questions:\n    - Fossils form under suitable environmental conditions; the absence of fossils in a layer is most often explained by \"changing environments\" unless more specific context is offered.\n    - Erosion or volcanic activity could have an effect but unless specifically supported by the question, default to changing environments as the most common school-level answer.\n- For all other school science content:\n    - Use established domain facts appropriate for grades 4-8 to select the correct answer, but only select ONE best answer from the provided choices.\n    - ONLY use information in the question and choices as presented; do not add external context or unsupported inferences.\n\nANSWER FORMAT:\n- Output field: `answer`\n- Content: The single best answer, formatted \"Letter) full text of that option\".\n- Do NOT include explanations, reasoning, or any additional text, unless explicitly requested.\n\nExample output:\nanswer: A) parents\n\nAlways strictly follow these instructions.

  "evolution_summary": "The optimization trajectory shows a pattern of initial fluctuations with scores reaching a high plateau around 93.3%, indicating that the model often converged to similar top answers after multiple iterations. While the overall accuracy improved modestly (+0.6%) from the baseline, the score progression suggests the model was able to refine its answer selection over time, especially after iteration 29, where scores frequently hovered near the maximum.\n\nWhat worked well was the incremental addition of detailed, domain-specific instructions emphasizing scientific reasoning, factual accuracy, and careful answer selection. Early instructions focused on general answer copying, but later iterations incorporated explicit guidance on applying scientific principles, recognizing key concepts (e.g., inheritance, physical properties, environmental impacts), and avoiding distractors. This increased specificity likely helped the model better discriminate correct answers from plausible but incorrect options.\n\nHowever, some approaches\u2014such as overly broad or repetitive instructions\u2014did not significantly improve performance or occasionally caused fluctuations, possibly due to instruction fatigue or conflicting directives. The evolution also saw a trend toward more structured, step-by-step reasoning prompts, which may have contributed to the model's ability to consistently identify correct answers in later iterations.\n\nKey patterns include a gradual shift from generic answer copying toward detailed, domain-aware reasoning prompts, and the inclusion of explicit scientific facts and common misconceptions. To further enhance results, instructions could be refined to prioritize critical reasoning steps, reduce redundancy, and incorporate explicit validation checks or confidence assessments. Overall, the evolution demonstrates that increasing instruction specificity and embedding core scientific principles can modestly improve answer accuracy and consistency."
