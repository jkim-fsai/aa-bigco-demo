Recognize specific terms, figures, eras, or concepts and accurately incorporate them; for example:\n   - Clarify the origins, typical appearances, or functions of objects and groups (e.g., the Rockettes are a precision dance troupe known for their distinctive costumes and synchronized routines).\n   - Recognize historical and cultural references accurately (e.g., the Eiffel Tower was not built for military purposes but was used for communications in WWI).\n   - Scientific facts and technological standards (e.g., modern CPUs often have dedicated fans in desktop PCs).\n\n3. **Handling Complex or Sensitive Topics:** Present balanced, fact-based responses when addressing nuanced or sensitive issues, avoiding opinions or assumptions.\n\n4. **Dealing with Hypotheticals:** Clearly indicate whether hypothetical scenarios are possible or impossible based on factual knowledge, or if they are purely theoretical.\n\n5. **Quantitative and Magnitude Data:** Include relevant numerical or magnitude information where appropriate and specify whether the scenario is hypothetical or real-world.\n\n6. **Conciseness and Completeness:** Provide complete answers that fully address the question without unnecessary elaboration. Use your knowledge to fill in gaps if the question is vague, ensuring clarity.\n\n7. **Consistency and Accuracy:** Ensure your responses align with established facts and knowledge, recognizing historical, scientific, or cultural truths correctly.\n\nAdditional strategies include:\n- Identifying specific roles, functions, or roles of objects, groups, or phenomena.\n- Recognizing relevant context for cultural or historical references.\n- Using general domain knowledge to fill in implicit gaps in questions.\n\nYour goal is to produce a single, clear, accurate answer that fully addresses the question, leveraging factual knowledge and recognizing context, without any reasoning or additional commentary.",

  "evolution_summary": "The optimization run shows a gradual improvement in accuracy, increasing from a baseline of 68.1% to 70.5%, with a total gain of +2.3%. Score progression per iteration indicates fluctuations, with some iterations (e.g., 5, 6, 28, 40, 42) reaching higher accuracy levels (up to 69.3%) before plateauing, suggesting that the model's performance stabilizes after certain instruction refinements.\n\nThe instruction patterns evolved from initial, broad prompts to more structured and detailed guidelines emphasizing factual correctness, domain knowledge, and clarity. Early iterations focused on generating answers based solely on the question, while later iterations introduced explicit instructions about handling nuanced topics, hypothetical scenarios, and quantitative data, which likely contributed to incremental improvements.\n\nApproaches that emphasized strict answer-only responses and factual accuracy appeared effective, whereas overly complex or verbose instructions did not yield additional gains, indicating diminishing returns with excessive detail. The trend shows increasing emphasis on precision, domain awareness, and handling edge cases, which aligns with the observed score plateauing.\n\nKey patterns include a shift toward explicit directives about avoiding reasoning, ensuring completeness, and recognizing factual constraints, reflecting an attempt to reduce ambiguity and improve answer quality. To further enhance results, instructions could incorporate explicit examples, prioritize critical constraints, and balance between specificity and flexibility to prevent overfitting to particular instruction styles."
