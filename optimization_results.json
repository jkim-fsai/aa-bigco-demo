Your response should be:\n- A clear, concise statement\n- Directly addressing the `question`\n- Using only the factual details explicitly present in the `context`, without any inference or speculation\n\nImportant guidelines:\n- Do not invent, infer, or assume information beyond what is explicitly stated or clearly implied in the `context`.\n- Focus on extracting the exact detail or fact that answers the `question`.\n- When the `question` asks about roles, relationships, origins, locations, dates, or specific facts, select the most accurate and relevant detail supported by the `context`.\n- If the necessary information to answer the `question` is not explicitly available, respond with \"The information is not available in the context.\"\n- Pay close attention to biographical, historical, or domain-specific details such as names, dates, places, organizational affiliations, and descriptions, as these are often critical for accurate, fact-based responses.\n- Many `context` fields may contain detailed factual data about people, events, works, organizations, or concepts. Carefully extract and use only those details that are directly relevant to the `question`.\n\nIn general:\n- Many questions seek specific facts about individuals, their roles, relationships, origins, locations, or noteworthy achievements.\n- The overall goal is to produce answers that are unambiguous, 100% accurate according to the `context`, and solely based on provided information.\n- Your answers should be straightforward, formal in tone, and without additional commentary or explanations.",

  "evolution_summary": "The optimization run showed limited success, with the overall accuracy decreasing slightly by 1.0% from the baseline of 66.0% to 65.0%, and score progression plateauing around 78%. Early iterations (e.g., Iteration 5) achieved modest improvements, but subsequent iterations (e.g., 26, 33, 36) showed minor fluctuations without clear upward trend, indicating diminishing returns from the current instruction strategies.\n\nThe instructions consistently emphasized extracting factual, domain-specific information directly from the `context`, with a focus on identifying relevant details such as names, dates, roles, and relationships. They also stressed the importance of concise, unambiguous answers and avoiding outside knowledge or assumptions. This pattern suggests that straightforward, fact-based extraction was prioritized, but the marginal score fluctuations imply that this approach alone may not be sufficient for significant gains.\n\nWhat didn't work well was overly generic or repetitive instruction formulations that did not adapt to the complexity of the data. The instructions remained largely similar across iterations, with little variation in constraints or strategies to handle ambiguous or complex cases. This static approach may have limited the model's ability to improve, especially given the nuanced and diverse nature of the contexts.\n\nNotable patterns include a persistent emphasis on strict reliance on the `context`, avoidance of reasoning, and the need for precise, factual answers. However, the lack of adaptive or more sophisticated prompting\u2014such as explicitly handling uncertain cases or encouraging clarification\u2014may have contributed to the plateau.\n\nTo improve results further, introducing more dynamic instruction patterns\u2014such as explicitly instructing the model to handle ambiguous or missing information, or to prioritize certain types of facts\u2014could help. Additionally, incorporating strategies for managing uncertainty or encouraging clarification might better guide the model to produce more accurate and consistent responses, potentially boosting overall performance."
