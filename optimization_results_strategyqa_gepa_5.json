Your response should only populate a single field called `answer`, containing a concise, definite reply.

  "evolution_summary": "The optimization trajectory shows a gradual improvement in scores, with notable jumps around iterations 4, 16, 20, 25, 32, and 34, indicating that the model responded positively to instruction refinements. The scores plateaued near 71.5%, suggesting diminishing returns from the current instruction set, but overall, the iterative process successfully enhanced performance from a baseline of 68.1% to 70.5%.\n\nThe instructions that consistently improved performance emphasized clarity, conciseness, and factual accuracy, often instructing the model to provide only the `answer` field without reasoning or elaboration. The pattern of gradually increasing specificity\u2014such as explicitly forbidding explanations, limiting responses to a single line, and focusing on definitive answers\u2014appears to have contributed to score gains. The instructions also progressively clarified the scope, including domain-specific knowledge, mythological references, and logistical considerations, which likely helped the model produce more precise responses.\n\nInstructions that added constraints\u2014such as avoiding restating questions, not providing supporting reasoning, or limiting output to a single line\u2014seemed effective in reducing extraneous content and improving answer quality. Conversely, overly broad or vague instructions that allowed multiple interpretations or did not specify format constraints tended to result in plateauing scores, indicating that clarity and strict formatting are critical.\n\nKey patterns in instruction evolution include a shift toward minimalism and explicitness: emphasizing only the `answer` field, discouraging explanations, and focusing on factual correctness. This trend suggests that further improvements could be achieved by tightening format constraints, explicitly discouraging any form of reasoning or elaboration, and possibly incorporating example responses to reinforce the desired output style. Overall, the evolution demonstrates that clear, concise, and format-specific instructions are most effective for optimizing model performance in this task."
