  "evolution_summary": "The optimization trajectory shows a generally positive trend, with scores fluctuating but ultimately improving from a baseline of 68.1% to 73.1%, a +4.9% gain. Early iterations exhibit minimal change, but significant jumps occur around iterations 3, 21, and 57, indicating that certain instruction modifications temporarily boosted performance before plateauing or fluctuating again. Overall, the scores suggest incremental improvements rather than a smooth, consistent ascent.\n\nThe instructions that emphasized detailed, step-by-step reasoning\u2014such as Iterations 3, 4, and 5\u2014correlated with notable score increases, indicating that encouraging explicit logical analysis and thorough explanations helped the model produce more accurate yes/no judgments. These prompts consistently directed the model to think aloud, analyze the question carefully, and produce a final definitive answer, which likely enhanced interpretability and correctness.\n\nConversely, earlier instructions that were more generic or less structured, such as Iteration 0 and 1, did not lead to significant improvements. Similarly, instructions that lacked explicit guidance on reasoning or did not specify the importance of detailed analysis tended to correspond with stagnant or declining scores. This suggests that increasing instruction specificity and emphasizing explicit reasoning steps were key factors in performance gains.\n\nKey patterns in instruction evolution include a shift toward explicitly prompting logical, step-by-step analysis (\"Let's think step by step\") and emphasizing factual verification. Over iterations, instructions became more detailed and structured, focusing on critical reasoning rather than superficial responses. To further improve results, incorporating more explicit constraints on reasoning depth, clarity, and factual grounding\u2014possibly with examples\u2014could enhance the model's ability to produce accurate, interpretable answers consistently."
