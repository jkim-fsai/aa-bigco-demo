  "evolution_summary": "The optimization run shows a generally positive trajectory, with the score improving from an initial baseline accuracy of 89.5% to a final of 91.1%, reflecting a +1.6% gain. Early iterations (1-4) achieved rapid improvements, reaching up to 97.1%, indicating that initial instruction modifications effectively enhanced the model's reasoning capabilities. However, subsequent iterations exhibited fluctuations, with scores oscillating between approximately 85.7% and 100%, suggesting diminishing returns and some instability in the optimization process.\n\nThe most effective strategy involved progressively emphasizing detailed, step-by-step reasoning prompts. Early instructions focused on generating logical, chain-of-thought explanations before selecting an answer, which helped improve accuracy. Over iterations, instructions became more explicit about analyzing options systematically, considering relevant scientific principles, and justifying each choice. This increased specificity and emphasis on clarity appeared to contribute to performance gains.\n\nLess effective approaches included overly vague or generic prompts that lacked explicit reasoning guidance, leading to score plateaus or declines. Additionally, attempts to simplify instructions or reduce reasoning steps sometimes resulted in decreased accuracy, indicating that thorough, structured reasoning prompts are crucial. The evolution shows a trend toward more detailed, structured instructions with explicit reasoning and answer justification.\n\nTo further improve results, incorporating explicit constraints, such as requesting reasoning summaries or highlighting key concepts, could enhance interpretability and accuracy. Additionally, experimenting with hybrid prompts that balance detailed reasoning with concise final answers may optimize both performance and efficiency. Overall, emphasizing systematic, transparent reasoning in instructions remains the most promising avenue for continued gains."
