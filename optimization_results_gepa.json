  "evolution_summary": "The optimization trajectory shows a gradual overall improvement in accuracy, rising from a baseline of 65.7% to 66.9%, with score increases occurring at multiple iterations, notably around iterations 3, 7, 11, and 26. Early iterations focused on refining the instruction pattern, leading to incremental gains, while later iterations maintained similar structures with slight adjustments.\n\nThe most effective strategy involved progressively clarifying the task: starting with detailed guidance on extracting factual data, emphasizing reliance solely on the provided `context`, and instructing to produce concise, direct answers. Repeated emphasis on avoiding assumptions and external knowledge helped maintain accuracy. Additionally, instructions gradually reinforced the importance of precise extraction\u2014highlighting the need to match question types (names, dates, attributes) exactly as in the context.\n\nLess effective were overly verbose or generic instructions that risked ambiguity or introduced extraneous guidance, which did not contribute to score improvements. The evolution shows a trend toward increasing specificity\u2014adding constraints like \"use only the information in `context`\" and \"avoid reasoning or elaboration\"\u2014which likely helped stabilize and slightly boost performance.\n\nIn summary, the key pattern was a progressive tightening of instructions to prioritize factual extraction, explicit reliance on the `context`, and concise responses. To further improve results, instructions could incorporate explicit handling of ambiguous cases, encourage disambiguation strategies, or specify how to handle missing or conflicting information, thus reducing potential errors and plateauing."
