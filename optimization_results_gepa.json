  "instruction": "Given a `context` paragraph or set of paragraphs and a `question` about the content, produce a concise `answer` that directly responds to the question based on the information in the context. Your answer should be accurate, specific, and ideally extract or infer the key factual information needed to answer the question. \n\n**Important points to follow:**\n\n- Carefully analyze the `context` to find relevant details that address the `question`.\n- Do not include information not supported by the `context`.\n- If the answer involves a person\u2019s name, position, event, date, or other factual data, ensure it matches the details provided.\n- When specific dates, years, or numbers are involved, verify that they are derived from or consistent with the `context`.\n- In cases where the question asks for a person\u2019s identity, title, or specific attribute, extract the appropriate information directly.\n- When a specific event or item (e.g., a rank, medal, title) is mentioned, ensure your answer reflects the precise label or designation provided.\n\n**Domain-specific guidance:**\n\n- For military or naval ranks, recognize that titles like \"Fleet Admiral,\" \"Admiral,\" \"Marshal-admiral,\" etc., are specific ranks with hierarchical implications.\n- For historical or biographical questions, rely solely on the provided bio or historical accounts.\n- For sports-related questions, pay attention to athlete names, event years, and medals awarded.\n- For questions involving organizations, awards, or recognition, derive the correct entity or individual based on explicit references in the context.\n- When multiple individuals or entities are mentioned regarding the same event, distinguish them clearly and select the correct one if the question is specific.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Use an extraction or inference strategy as needed. If the information is explicitly stated, extract it directly. If not explicitly stated but implied, infer carefully based on context.\n- Maintain a neutral tone and avoid conjecture.\n- Keep the answer brief, relevant, and aligned with the question.\n\nYour goal is to generate accurate, contextually grounded answers that demonstrate understanding of detailed factual information provided in the context, following the specific instructions above.",

  "evolution_summary": "The optimization run shows a general upward trajectory in model performance, with accuracy improving from a baseline of 66.2% to 68.1%, and iterative scores reaching as high as 71.1%. Early iterations suggest that the model responds well to instructions emphasizing precise, factual extraction, as evidenced by repeated success in reaching high scores following instructions that stress direct support from the context.\n\nThe instructions that proved most effective consistently emphasized extracting explicit facts, avoiding assumptions, and maintaining neutrality. Instructions that focused on precise, direct answers\u2014such as \"use only the information explicitly stated\"\u2014correlated with score improvements. Conversely, more complex or verbose instructions, or those that introduced ambiguity or multiple inference layers, did not significantly enhance performance and sometimes caused score plateaus or slight declines.\n\nA notable pattern is the increasing emphasis on clarity, brevity, and reliance on explicit support within the instructions. Over iterations, instructions evolved to reinforce extracting exact details, disallowing extraneous or inferred information, which likely contributed to the observed score peaks. The iterative process suggests that further gains could be achieved by refining instructions to balance explicit support with minimal inference, possibly incorporating structured extraction prompts or constraints to reduce ambiguity.\n\nIn summary, the key to further improvement lies in maintaining strict extraction-focused instructions, reducing complexity, and ensuring the model prioritizes explicit evidence. Additional strategies might include explicitly instructing the model to ignore extraneous details, or to verify the support for each part of its answer, thereby enhancing precision and consistency in responses."
