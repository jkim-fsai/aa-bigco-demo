Your task is to select the most appropriate choice from the given options that best answers the question based on logical reasoning, factual knowledge, and domain-specific understanding.\n\n**Guidelines for completing the task:**\n\n1. **Understand the question thoroughly:** Carefully read the question to identify its core focus, whether it involves scientific concepts, biological mechanisms, environmental facts, or other domain-specific knowledge.\n\n2. **Evaluate each choice critically:**\n   - Use reasoning grounded in factual, scientific, or domain-based knowledge.\n   - Consider relevance, accuracy, and how well each choice addresses the question\u2019s core.\n   - Identify relationships such as periodic table groupings (for chemistry), physiological processes (for biology), properties of substances, or scientific principles.\n\n3. **Apply scientific and factual principles:**\n   - For scientific questions, rely on established facts such as:\n     - Elements in the same group of the periodic table have similar chemical properties.\n     - Sexual dimorphism in animals often results from hormonal differences.\n     - Pure substances have definite chemical formulas and consist of only one type of element or compound.\n   - Consider biological, chemical, or environmental mechanisms as appropriate for the question.\n\n4. **Select the best choice:**\n   - Choose the option that most accurately and comprehensively answers the question based on the reasoning and factual knowledge.\n   - When multiple options seem plausible, prioritize the one most consistent with scientific principles and evidence.\n\n5. **Format your answer concisely:**\n   - Present your selection in the same format as the options (e.g., `'A) ...'`, `'B) ...'`, etc.).\n   - Do not include additional reasoning or explanation unless specifically asked.\n\n**Important considerations:**\n\n- The questions might relate to science, biology, chemistry, environment, or other factual domains.\n- The choices are labeled with standard options (A, B, C, D).\n- Your response should be specific and directly identify the best answer, demonstrating clear reasoning based on scientific principles and factual accuracy.\n- Familiarize yourself with general scientific concepts such as element groups in the periodic table, principles of chemical and biological processes, properties of substances, and scientific definitions pertinent to the question.\n\nThis set of instructions is designed to help you systematically analyze each question, apply domain knowledge accurately, and select the most appropriate choice with clear, concise formatting.

  "evolution_summary": "The optimization trajectory shows a gradual improvement in accuracy, increasing from a baseline of 89.5% to 90.3%, with score progressions per iteration indicating consistent gains, especially after iteration 11. Early instructions focused on detailed reasoning and domain-specific analysis, which contributed to initial improvements. Over time, the instructions emphasized critical evaluation of choices, application of factual knowledge, and logical deduction, leading to more precise answer selection.\n\nStrategies that proved effective included instructing the model to analyze each choice critically, justify selections briefly, and prioritize scientific or domain facts. The iterative refinement also involved clarifying that responses should be concise, formatted correctly, and based solely on factual correctness without extraneous reasoning unless explicitly requested. Notably, the instructions evolved to stress the importance of applying scientific principles directly\u2014such as element groupings, inheritance patterns, or experimental validation methods\u2014improving the model\u2019s ability to produce accurate, justified answers.\n\nLess effective approaches involved overly broad or vague directives, which sometimes led to inconsistent reasoning. As instructions became more specific\u2014highlighting the need for domain knowledge, logical evaluation, and precise formatting\u2014the model's performance improved. The trend suggests that increasing instruction clarity, emphasizing factual grounding, and guiding the model to produce well-justified answers enhances accuracy.\n\nTo further improve results, recommendations include integrating explicit examples of correct reasoning, reinforcing the importance of domain-specific facts, and constraining answer formats to reduce ambiguity. Additionally, iterative feedback emphasizing the importance of avoiding extraneous explanations and focusing on direct, justified answers could help solidify the model\u2019s ability to produce high-quality, accurate responses consistently."
