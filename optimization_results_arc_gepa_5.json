Ocean fish and terrestrial animals (like lions or bears) are much less affected.\n- For safety equipment or tool-related questions, match the equipment to investigative scenarios where it\u2019s required based on risk factors (e.g., physical hazards outdoors warrant hard hats).\n- For questions involving plant nutrients or decomposition, select organic matter that naturally breaks down into soil nutrients (e.g., leaves).\n- Always return only the best answer based strictly on provided choices and the question context.",

A galaxy contains billions of stars and thus has the greatest mass among typical choices.\n    - For mixture questions, recall that a mixture is formed when more than one substance is physically combined but not chemically bonded, and the substances retain their properties. The defining feature is the presence of more than one substance.\n    - For questions about soap bubbles, note that the inside of a soap bubble is filled with air, while the outer layer is a thin film of soap and water.\n    - For questions about producers or chloroplasts in food webs, chloroplasts indicate the organism is capable of photosynthesis (captures energy from sunlight), but do not assume specifics about ecosystem type or number of single-celled organisms unless stated.\n\n- Always answer strictly according to the input question and choices, and never add extra commentary or step-by-step reasoning unless specifically requested.",

DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE EXPECTATIONS (include and apply these key points):\n   - For renewable/nonrenewable resources: Recognize that resources like coal, minerals, and petroleum are non-renewable, while sunlight is renewable.\n   - For scientific investigations: Steps communicating results are those that involve recording or reporting observations/data, NOT listing materials, writing procedures, or merely conducting multiple trials.\n   - For technology and privacy (including biometrics like fingerprints): The main benefit to customers is typically the protection of private information. \"Immediate funds credited\" is NOT typically the main consumer benefit; privacy protection is the correct educational focus.\n   - For body systems: The cardiovascular system is responsible for transporting gases (oxygen and CO2); the nervous system controls breathing but does not transport gases.\n   - For genetics and traits: Inherited traits are determined primarily by genetics from parents, not by environment or learned behavior unless explicitly s...

  "evolution_summary": "The optimization trajectory shows fluctuating but generally improving performance, with the accuracy reaching peaks around 93.3% before slight declines. Early iterations involved broad, general instructions emphasizing scientific reasoning and proper answer formatting, which yielded initial score gains. Over time, instructions became more explicit about selecting the most scientifically accurate choice, often emphasizing domain knowledge and careful analysis, leading to higher peak scores.\n\nAttempts to refine the instructions included clarifying answer formatting, stressing the importance of domain-specific knowledge (e.g., physics, biology, environmental science), and discouraging extraneous reasoning. Some iterations introduced more detailed guidelines on interpreting scientific concepts (e.g., properties of elements, inheritance patterns, environmental impacts), which helped improve the correctness of selections. However, overly complex or overly prescriptive instructions occasionally caused fluctuations, indicating a need for balance.\n\nNotably, the instructions evolved from broad directives (\"select the correct answer\") to more precise, knowledge-based criteria (\"use established scientific facts,\" \"apply domain-specific rules\"). This shift suggests that emphasizing factual correctness and scientific reasoning, rather than procedural or stylistic constraints, enhances performance. The iterative process also included clarifications on answer formatting and the importance of only outputting the final choice, which contributed to more consistent results.\n\nTo further improve outcomes, recommendations include maintaining a focus on core scientific principles, reducing overly complex constraints that may introduce confusion, and explicitly reinforcing the importance of selecting answers based on factual accuracy rather than superficial cues. Incorporating example questions with correct answers as anchors could also help guide the model toward more precise, knowledge-driven responses."
